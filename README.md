# COMPSCIX433.3
Final Project Inputs

Goal: Analyze historical CAISO data and identify methods for determining "high demand days" and using FFT to determine cycles of energy trends.

Packages and Modules:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Data Access:
Given the complexity of CAISO OASIS for the data that is required, go to https://rapidapi.com/buildingviz-buildingviz-default/api/caiso/details to run the "caiso" endpoint. It provides supply, demand, and CO2 data starting from April of 2018. 

Comments
- caiso_data.csv is as of August 1, 2023. You can always change the start and end date within the API inputs to collect more up-to-date information
